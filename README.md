# Interactive Brokers Gateway HELM 3 Chart to deploy to Kubernetes

HELM 3 chart to deploy IB Gateway running in Docker to a Kubernetes cluster. Currently has basic TCP port monitoring so Kubernetes will restart the instance, if it stops responding.

### Docker Hub image

* https://hub.docker.com/r/forhire/ibgwdocker

### Deploying

* To deploy, create a values.yaml outside this repo with your IB Gateway credentials

```
IBAuth: true
TWSUSERID: "YOUR_IB_USERNAME_HERE"
TWSPASSWORD: "YOUR_IB_PASSWORD_HERE"
VNC_PASSWORD: "YOUR_VNC_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

and 

```export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig```

Then, deploy with:

```
helm3 install ibgw ./ibgw/  -f values.yaml 
```

### Troubleshooting

Kubernetes kubectl commands can be used for troubleshooting. Typically:
```kubectl get all ```

to get the POD name.

```kubectl describe pod/ibgw-unique-values```

to show details about the POD.
